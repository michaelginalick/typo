Hello, my name is Mike. Currently, I work as a software developer in the Chicago area. My current interests are focused in Go, and working within the AWS infrastructure. Thankfully, that is what the majority of my working time entails. I have a graduate degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Computer Science although I'm not a computer scientist.

In my free time I enjoy running, biking and swimming. I also read occasionally but not as much as I should.
